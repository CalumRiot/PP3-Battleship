# **Battleships**

## **Portfolio 3 Project: A command-line application using Python**

## **Summary:**
Battleships is a strategy type guessing game where two players i.e player vs player or player vs ai, take turns attempting to sink each others battleships. The location of each players battleship is choosen at the start of the game and players can sink there opponents battleships by guessing where in a set grid there battleship is. Whoever is the first to destroy there opponents battleships wins. The origins of the game are debated however the first commercially available version of the game was sold in 1931 in the USA under the name of Salvo.

## **User Experience:**

### **Planning:**
Before coding the game I decided to map out what functions would be required for the game such as a function to create the board, a function to place the ships on the board, a function to check if the user/computer ships has been hit. I also had to plan out the associated rules that would be required with these functions some included making sure the user selected a valid row/column such as A,B,C and 1,2,3. Another rule that was also required was to ensure that the computer didn't guess the same place on the board twice, Another rule was to ensure battleships weren't placed on top of one another etc. A mapped out design of the functions method I used prior to starting the project can be found below.

### **User Stories:**

- User would like to play an online version of the classic Battleship game
- User would like the game to be as similar as possible to the boardgame version
- User would like to be presented with clear instructions on how the play
- User would like to play the game on his own versus a competent cpu bot
